This lecture discussed domain modelling and using a ubiquitous language
to better communicate between developers and domain experts.

The example given here is about checking whether a student can graduate.

A naive model is given in `draft` and a slightly improved model is given in `v2`.
Notably the improved model uses the terminology that domain experts would use to talk about graduation checks.

## Disclaimer
The code in this repository is gross and bug full and not a good demonstration of good practice.
The key takeaway should be the promotion of the domain experts language into code objects.
